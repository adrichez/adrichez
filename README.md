## About me:
I am a restless 22-year-old from a small town in Jaén, Beas de Segura 🌳. From a very young age I have always been passionate about discovering how everything works, investigating the why of things, socializing, meeting new cultures and people, so I enjoy constantly acquiring knowledge and traveling in order to create new experiences. I have always tried to keep myself busy and to combine work with studies, since I consider helping the family as essential, which is why **from an early age I decided to work both in sectors such as hospitality, agriculture and education. 🍽️**

Not losing sight of my desire to see the world, **I participated in the 1st year of Baccalaureate in an Exchange Program in the city of Brighton, England 🇬🇧.** Incredible experience in which I met a multitude of wonderful people and which helped me to increase my desire to live similar experiences.

Thus, **in 2019 I began the Degree in Statistics at the University of Granada 🎓**, given that the world of science, mathematics, computing, economics and events as simple as the launch of a currency. Today, once this process is finished, I can say that it has been one of the best decisions I have made. Taking advantage of this adventure, **I decided to immerse myself in the Erasmus experience during the 2021/2022 academic year with the Università degli Studi di Padova, Italy 🇮🇹**, a country and people who helped me grow as a person and live experiences that I would never have imagined before. Without a doubt one of the best experiences of my life. 🌍

We reached the year 2023, where all this effort has been rewarded with the unexpected event of **being part of the 20 students selected by the University of Granada for the Professional Skills Acceleration Program of the UGR Talent Incubator 🎖️**, a unique and incredible training opportunity through experiential learning in soft skills such as servant leadership, assertive communication, emotional management, teamwork, organizational skills and SDGs. Absolutely, it has been a great experience of personal development and together with coaching and mentoring seminars, it has been the finishing touch to this university experience.

Having summarized my life in broad strokes, saying that this is just the beginning, I consider myself a proactive person who loves challenges, so there is still a long way to go! 💪

If you have come this far I would love to connect with you and be able to talk. 😊
